### Areas of focus

- <b>Null values (3) row wise<b> 
- The threshold was set to 3 or less null values per row, because more than three null values are resulting in more than 1/3rd of the data of the row as null values. 
- so 3 as a threshold is taken to keep the null values below or approximately 1/3rd of the row data. And we are focusing on row as each represent individual companies.
- so instead of focusing on the column or taking the metric as a whole, since each of the companies' metrics are interconnected, the null values per row is focused.
